wf-help-example
===============

This is a quick stub/draft to illustrate, what the wf-help section could potentially look like.

Installation / Test drive
-------------------------

    git clone
    npm install
    bower install
    node app.js
    <open browser at localhost:3000>

Parts / Technologies used
-------------------------

* AngularJS
* Bootstrap
* Angular-UI
* bower (to install client side dependencies like angular and bootstrap)
* Jade templating

Explanation
-----------

The node server underneath does absolutely not need to be there, it just makes showing the draft easier.

The bootstap + angular + angular-ui parts are pefectly enough and should fit the current setup/infrastructure.
